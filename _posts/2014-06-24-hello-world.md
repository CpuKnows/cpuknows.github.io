==============

In college I was hired at the computational biology lab. It was such a cool opportunity to work on interesting and challenging problems. Their [lead project] [compbio] was an algorithm for identifying the unique stripe patterns on zebras to help research and track herds to map their social networks. They had even sent a group of students to Kenya the year before to conduct field research. The head of the lab started me off with a simpler population biology problem and then said go solve it. I had the freedom to work alone whenever I wanted to and log the hours as I pleased to get paid. It sounded like a dream job for college. A week later I got a job in IT at the college and quit the lab without logging any hours.

Why did I do this? Frankly the open endedness of the job, having to create goals and break down a problem without guidance scared me. I knew (or perhaps irrationally feared) I wasn't mature enough to handle the challenge so I quit. It is my greatest regret of college.

Ever since going to college I’ve had a little bit of [imposter syndrome] [imposter] ( this isn’t my post, but you get the idea ). It’s part of the reason I research and work with different technologies in my spare time. I really enjoy the world of programming and think that there are so many exciting things happening in this field, but that fear is also present.

I’m leaving my job this summer so I can pursue a career shift from working in embedded development to machine learning and data sciences. Much of this blog is dedicated to documenting my efforts to master this new field and provide inspiration for others seeking to do the same, but I’ll also touch on other professional and personal challenges. I’m taking this step without the safety net of having a job lined up. ( Not that I’m worried about getting a job, but the worst case scenario is that it won’t be the job I want. ) This means that it’s crucial for me to structure and use my time off effectively. I will need to visualize all the necessary steps and my end goal. It’ll require a great amount of willpower to get up every morning (including weekends) and work several hours when it would be trivially easy for me to blow off a day with no responsibilities to stop me. I’m seeking to foster confidence and self sufficiency in myself to prove that I can overcome any obstacles in the future.

In essence I’m going back to the computational biology lab. The new me is everything that I wasn’t able to handle back then. I truly believe that programming is an art and it’s ridiculous to think one can master it in college or even 10 years after. I’ve grown a lot since college, but I still have a long way to go. I’ve always enjoyed and learned a lot from people’s personal dev blogs so I’m excited to start my own. I hope anyone who reads this will continue to follow my journey because all of you are part of my motivation not to fail.
