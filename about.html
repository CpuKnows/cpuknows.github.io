<h3><i>For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.</i></h3>

    I'm John, but more importantly I'm a programmer. I've spent my prior employment working in IT and embedded software, but now I'm on a new trajectory. This blog mostly serves to document my efforts to master machine learning and data science although I'll also touch on other professional and personal challenges.

    What a great profession to be in! I can learn anything I need with enough Googling, and many of the tools and resources are freely available. I'm fascinated by almost anything we can accomplish with a computer like machine learning, interactive art and game development. I'm a huge proponent of jumping in and getting your hands dirty so I have a ton of fun doing code jams and competitions.

    Board games bring a welcome, and tactile, break from working on the computer. I'd encourge everyone that has to sit at a desk all day to get into friendly competition with your coworkers over a game of basketball, and unwind at night through latin dance.
